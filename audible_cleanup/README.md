\# Audible Data Cleaning Project



\## Overview

This project demonstrates cleaning and merging two messy CSV datasets (users, sales, activity) for an Audible-style dataset. The goal was to produce analysis-ready data and document the workflow.



\## Files

\- `cleaning\_notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with step-by-step cleaning and merging

\- `merged\_sales\_users.csv` — Cleaned and merged sales + users data

\- `merged\_activity\_users.csv` — Cleaned and merged activity + users data



\## Skills Demonstrated

\- Handling missing values and duplicates

\- Cleaning inconsistent strings, dates, and currency fields

\- Parsing multiple date formats

\- Merging relational datasets

\- Documenting cleaning decisions and rationale

\- Preparing data for aggregation and analysis



\## Usage

1\. Open the Jupyter notebook (`cleaning\_notebook.ipynb`) to see the full workflow.

2\. The CSVs are clean and ready to use in Python, pandas, SQL, or other analysis tools.
