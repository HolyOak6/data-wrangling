# Audible Data Cleaning Project



## Overview

This project demonstrates cleaning and merging two messy CSV datasets (users, sales, activity) for an Audible-style dataset. The goal was to produce analysis-ready data and document the workflow.



## Files

- `cleaning\_notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with step-by-step cleaning and merging

## Skills Demonstrated

- Handling missing values and duplicates

- Cleaning inconsistent strings, dates, and currency fields

- Parsing multiple date formats

- Merging relational datasets

- Documenting cleaning decisions and rationale

- Preparing data for aggregation and analysis



## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`cleaning\_notebook.ipynb`) to see the full workflow.

2. The CSVs are clean and ready to use in Python, pandas, SQL, or other analysis tools.
