# Michael's Data Wrangling Portfolio

Welcome to my data wrangling portfolio! This repository showcases my ability to clean, manipulate, and analyze datasets using **Python (pandas)** and **SQL**, producing actionable insights and portfolio-ready outputs. Each project demonstrates real-world skills and techniques relevant to data analysis, reporting, and automation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Spotify Dataset Analysis (SQL)
- **Description:** Analyzed a Spotify songs dataset using SQL queries to explore artist popularity, genre distribution, label performance, and top tracks.
- **Key Skills:** `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`), aggregations, filtering.
- **Highlights:** 
  - Identified artists with the highest average popularity.
  - Found top songs per genre and self-produced tracks.
  - Explored genre diversity among artists.

### 2. [Pandas Project 1: Title]
- **Description:** Used pandas to clean and analyze [dataset description].
- **Key Skills:** DataFrame operations, `groupby`, filtering, aggregations, visualization.
- **Highlights:** [Briefly mention 1â€“2 interesting results or visualizations].

### 3. [Pandas Project 2: Title]
- **Description:** Applied data wrangling techniques to [dataset description].
- **Key Skills:** Handling missing data, reshaping, merging datasets.
- **Highlights:** [Key insights or outputs].

### 4. [Pandas Project 3: Title]
- **Description:** Focused on [dataset description] to extract meaningful insights.
- **Key Skills:** Advanced pandas operations, string manipulation, conditional transformations.
- **Highlights:** [Key result or takeaway].

### 5. [Pandas Project 4: Title]
- **Description:** Conducted exploratory data analysis and preprocessing for [dataset description].
- **Key Skills:** Aggregations, pivot tables, date/time handling.
- **Highlights:** [Key result or takeaway].

## Notes
- All projects are designed to be **portfolio-ready**, with clean, reproducible code.
- SQL projects can be executed in a MySQL environment.
- Pandas projects are built in Python 3 using virtual environments (`venv`).

---

## Next Steps
- Expand SQL portfolio with additional datasets and complex queries.
- Integrate visualizations to complement analyses.
- Continuously refine projects based on feedback and new datasets.
