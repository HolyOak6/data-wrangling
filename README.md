# Michael's Data Wrangling Portfolio

Welcome to my data wrangling portfolio! This repository showcases my ability to clean, manipulate, and analyze datasets using **Python (pandas)** and **SQL**, producing actionable insights and portfolio-ready outputs. Each project demonstrates real-world skills and techniques relevant to data analysis, reporting, and automation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Spotify Dataset Analysis (SQL)
- **Description:** Analyzed a Spotify songs dataset using SQL queries to explore artist popularity, genre distribution, label performance, and top tracks.
- **Key Skills:** `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`), aggregations, filtering.
- **Highlights:** 
  - Identified artists with the highest average popularity.
  - Found top songs per genre and self-produced tracks.
  - Explored genre diversity among artists.

### 2. Movies Dataset Analysis 1
- **Description:** Used pandas to clean and analyze multiple movie datasets, including movie metadata and user ratings, to create a unified dataset ready for exploration.
- **Key Skills:** DataFrame operations, `groupby`, filtering, aggregations, merging datasets, handling missing values, text cleaning with regex.
- **Highlights:** Cleaned movie titles by removing year parentheses and merged datasets on `movieId` and `title`. Identified the top-rated movies and explored rating trends by genre.


### 3. Movies Dataset Analysis 2
- **Description:** Applied data wrangling techniques to Netflix movie and user rating datasets to uncover trends in ratings and user behavior.
- **Key Skills:** Handling missing data, reshaping DataFrames, merging datasets, grouping, filtering, calculating aggregates, and visualizing results.
- **Highlights:** Merged movie and rating datasets, identified top-rated movies and most active/generous users, analyzed rating trends by release decade, and visualized key insights with histograms and bar charts.


### 4. Treasury API to Pandas Dataset Analysis
- **Description:** Focused on U.S. Treasury operating cash balance data to extract trends in account activity over time.
- **Key Skills:** Advanced pandas operations, API data extraction, time series manipulation, string handling, and conditional transformations.
- **Highlights:** Fetched and cleaned Treasury data via the Fiscal Data API, calculated daily and weekly balance changes, visualized trends by account type, and prepared a ready-to-use dataset for further analysis.


### 5. Sales Analysis
- **Description:** Conducted exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on a Kaggle JSON sales dataset to uncover regional and product-level trends.
- **Key Skills:** Aggregations, pivot tables, date/time handling, data cleaning, and visualization.
- **Highlights:** Identified top-performing states, regions, and products; visualized sales trends with plots; and exported a cleaned dataset for reporting and further analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Wrangling & Analysis:** Python (pandas), SQL
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, data type conversions
- **Aggregation & Grouping:** Summarizing datasets efficiently
- **Filtering & Conditional Logic:** Extracting targeted insights
- **Basic Data Exploration & Visualization:** Identifying trends and patterns

## Notes
- All projects are designed to be **portfolio-ready**, with clean, reproducible code.
- SQL projects can be executed in a MySQL environment.
- Pandas projects are built in Python 3 using virtual environments (`venv`).

---

## Next Steps
- Expand SQL portfolio with additional datasets and complex queries.
- Integrate visualizations to complement analyses.
- Continuously refine projects based on feedback and new datasets.
